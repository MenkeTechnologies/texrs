//! Which fusevm execution tier a program's bytecode actually reaches.
//!
//! Enabling the JIT is not the same as being compiled by it, and the only
//! honest way to tell the two apart is to ask the VM. This module runs a
//! program and then queries fusevm's own eligibility and cache predicates —
//! `is_block_eligible`, `block_jit_is_compiled`, `trace_is_compiled`,
//! `find_jit_region` — so the answer comes from the compiler that would have
//! done the work rather than from an assumption about it.
//!
//! `texrs --tiers file.tex` prints the report.
